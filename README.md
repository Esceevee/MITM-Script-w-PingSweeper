# MITM-Script-w-PingSweeper
Custom MITM (Sniffing) Tool

This tool is for educational purposes only!

This is a simple tool composed of a ping sweeper script and a man-in-the-middle script that tricks other the devices of a network into thinking that an attacker's computer is a router. 

As of 7/26/2019, it only works on a local network's devices but it can (and may) be further improved upon for remote attacks and for ease of use.

Rquires:

Scapy (Packet manipulation tool for computer networks)
A Debian-derived Linux distro (Has only been tested on Kali)
Python 2.7 (Have only been tested to work on Python 2.7)
